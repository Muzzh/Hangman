Give it a shot
Speak your mind
A piece of cake
Slipped my mind
Cross your fingers
Be in hot water
It cost an arm and a leg
It's in the bag
Get cold feet
A rip off
Get a kick out of
Read between the lines
Have mixed feelings
Draw a blank
Have a change of heart
Be second to none
Get your act together
Play it by ear
Have second thoughts
A basket case
Have a shot at
Be in the same boat
Out of the blue
A grey area
Give someone the cold shoulder
I'm all ears
See eye to eye
Call it a day
The icing on the cake
Fish out of water
Kettle of fish
Get off your high horse
Hold your horses
Horse of a different color
Let the cat out of the bag
Curiosity killed the cat
Cat got your tongue
Raining cats and dogs
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
Doggy bag
A little birdie told me
Bee in her bonnet
Goose is cooked
For the birds
Birdbrain
But a bug in his ear
A bull in a china shop
Pig out
Wolf in sheep's clothing
Cry crocodile tears
Make a mountain out of a molehill
